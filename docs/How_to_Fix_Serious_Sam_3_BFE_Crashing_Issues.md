Before trying any of the solutions below, make sure you have the latest version of the game and your graphics card driver installed.

- Processor: Dual-core from Intel or AMD at 2.0 GHz
- Memory: 1GB

If you still experience crashes after updating your game and driver and meeting the requirements, try the following solutions:

1. Verify the integrity of your game files on Steam. To do this, right-click on Serious Sam 3 BFE in your Steam library, select Properties, then Local Files, then Verify Integrity of Game Files. This will scan and repair any missing or corrupted files in your game folder.
2. Run the game as an administrator. To do this, right-click on Serious Sam 3 BFE in your Steam library, select Properties, then Compatibility, then check the box that says Run this program as an administrator. This will give the game more permissions to access your system resources.
3. Disable any antivirus or firewall software that may interfere with the game. Some antivirus or firewall programs may block or delete some files or processes that are essential for the game to run properly. You can temporarily disable them while playing the game, but make sure to enable them again afterwards.
4. Change the compatibility mode of the game. To do this, right-click on Serious Sam 3 BFE in your Steam library, select Properties, then Compatibility, then select a different compatibility mode from the drop-down menu. You can try Windows XP SP3, Windows Vista SP2, or Windows 7 SP1 modes and see if any of them works better for you.
5. Lower your graphics settings in the game. To do this, launch the game and go to Options, then Video Options, then Advanced Options. You can lower the resolution, texture quality, anti-aliasing, shadow quality, and other settings to improve your performance and stability.

If none of these solutions work for you, you can contact the game's developer Croteam or publisher Devolver Digital for further assistance. You can also check their official forums or Steam discussions for more tips and feedback from other players who may have faced similar issues.
